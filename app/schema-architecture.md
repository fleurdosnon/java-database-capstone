This Spring Boot application uses both MVC and REST controllers. 
Thymeleaf templates are used for the Admin and Doctor dashboards, while REST APIs serve all other modules. 
The application interacts with two databasesâ€”MySQL (for patient, doctor, appointment, and admin data) and MongoDB (for prescriptions). 
All controllers route requests through a common service layer, which in turn delegates to the appropriate repositories. 
MySQL uses JPA entities while MongoDB uses document models.

1. User accesses AdminDashboard or Appointment pages.
2. The action is routed to the appropriate Thymeleaf or REST controller.
3. The controller calls the service layer.
4. The service layer calls either a mySQL or a MongoDB repository
5. The repository calls its dedicated Database (MySQL or MongoDB)
6. The mySQL data is mapped to Java model classes
7. The data  is returned as a JPA entity mapped to the requested models
